## NFV-Automation

### Introduction
This sample code shows the value of using the APIs integrated into Cisco's NFV technology:
NFVIS.  To demonstrate how to use these APIs, Postman will be used to show how the APIs
function, and how to chain multiple APIs together to complete more complex processes.

To effectively use this demonstration, you will need to have Postman installed,
an NFVIS system such as ENCS, and VNFs to deploy.
