# NFV-Automation
This code demonstrates how using the REST APIs inside Cisco's ENCS and NFVIS can automate deployments of VNFs.  Additionally, it makes use of other REST APIs for other Cisco products like SD-WAN and Firepower Management Center to show how complete SD-Branch deployments can be accomplished through their APIs.

This module focuses on leveraging the advanced functions of Postman to automate the REST API calls for these systems to completely provision an SD-Branch system.

To run this code, you will need an instance of NFVIS and access to VNFs for vEdge and any additional VNFs of interest.  There are two different examples posted in this repository:  the first uses vEdge Cloud and vRiverbed, the second uses vEdge Cloud and virtual Firesight Threat Defense.  

For more detailed instructions, refer to the documentation section inside each of the two different modules.
